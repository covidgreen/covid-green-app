If you're in a home with other people, make sure there’s a door to separate the area from the rest of your home and keep it closed. If you must share a bathroom, have plenty of cleaning supplies (like household disinfectant wipes, bleach) to clean all surfaces after each use.\n\n2. **Stay at home and don’t leave your property.**\nDon’t go out into public. It’s important to avoid contact with other people, even your family.\n\n3. **Secure your living area.**\nKeep others from entering without your permission.\n\n4. **Wash your hands often.**\nMake sure you have access to a sink with soap, water, and plenty of paper towels.\n\n5. **Sleep by yourself.**\nIf you are in quarantine with others, sleep in separate bedrooms. You could start to have symptoms while you sleep.\n\n6. **Have food brought to you.**\nDon’t leave your living area to get or prepare food.\n\n7. **Bag up your garbage and leave it outside your door. **\nAsk someone else to pick it up regularly. (No special handling is needed.)\n\n8. **Keep a supply of face masks.**\nWear one if you start to have symptoms or must come in contact with others.\n\n9. **Monitor your temperature and symptoms carefully.**\nYou can keep track of them in the 'My Health Log' feature of this app or another way. A daily log helps Health Workers figure out the most effective treatments for you if you get sick.\n\n10. **Call ahead if you must leave to get health care.**\nTell the health care provider about your exposure to COVID-19.
