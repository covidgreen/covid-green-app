_*Day-to-Day COntact Tracing*_

NOTE: COVID Green is implemented using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification API. This ensures reliable operation of Contact Tracing on all compatible devices
- Google - https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/
- Apple  - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/exposurenotification
- Must support exposure event detection based on current ECDC Case Definition
    -   2 Metres
    -   15 minutes
- Must support Contact Tracing by collecting Exposure events from other devices without user interaction
- *Should not detect users that do not match the case definition
- Diagnosis keys of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 will be checked at least 1 time every 2 hours
- Exposure checks will not require user interaction
- The system will _NOT_ use any other phone sensor data e.g. geol location
## Exposure Event Detection
*Outcome: Notify a user when they get a close contact exposure notification and get them to take appropriate measures*
- App must download and refresh Diagnosis keys at least every 2 hours
- User must compare downloaded Diagnosis keys against locally collected Rolling Proximity Identifiers
- App must alert a user if a Close Contact Exposure Event has occurred that matches the current Case Definition
- App must maintain an alert in the app for a user on all core app cards to ensure the user knows an Close Contact Exposure Event occurred
- User should be able to dismiss and remove the Close Contact Exposure Event in the app
- App should store the date the Close Contact Exposure Event received and the days since the last Close Contact Exposure Event occurred.
- when an exposure event is detected the app will immediately notify the user via in-app notification
- when an exposure event is detected the app will prominently display the exposure event in the app
- when an exposure event is detected the app will provide the user with guidance on what to do now & next
- the app will remove the notification from within the app 14 days after the date of exposure
- the app will notifiy the user of all subsequent exposure events after the first event

## Follow-on call Notification
![Follow-on Call Notifcation](https://app.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/820fd0ad-ad6e-4818-b9d3-abe799bf29b0/image.png)
If a user has requested a follow-on call from the HSE based on receipt of a close contact exposure notification request
- the App will upload the request using the CallBack Request service
- the request is queued to speed response to the app and to support retry attempts to  CCT
- the CCT worker processes requests and sends them to the API
- requests are held on a SNS queue until processed max 48 hours (average retention <1  hour)
