| Public Subnet             | Network             | AWS          | A public subnet is a subnet that's associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway. A private subnet with a size /24 IPv4 CIDR block (example: 10.0. 1.0/24). This provides 256 private IPv4 addresses                                                                                               |
| Private Subnet            | Network             | AWS          | This provides 256 private IPv4 addresses. A public subnet is a subnet that's associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway. A private subnet with a size /24 IPv4 CIDR block (example: 10.0. 1.0/24). ... This connects the VPC to the Internet and to other AWS services.                         |
| Application Load Balancer | Load Balancer       | AWS          | A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients.

| AWS Aurora PostresSQL     | Database            | AWS          | Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL is a fully managed, PostgreSQL-compatible, and ACID-compliant relational database engine that combines the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases.                                                            |
| Lambda Function           | Serverless Function | AWS          | AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security. |
| SNS                       | Pub/Sub             | AWS          | Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications                                                                                                      |
