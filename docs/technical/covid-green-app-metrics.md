# Core COVID Green App indicator set
The indicators cover 4 areas: adoption and use; contact tracing; symptom tracking; and, epidemiology. The purpose of the first three areas is performance monitoring, while the fourth is analysis and modelling. Data is measured daily for each indicator and can be reported daily, cumulatively, or as events occur.

| Adoption & Use metrics                           | These indicators are important to monitor the penetration of the app and to assess the usefulness and representativeness of any data that arises from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | indicators are necessary for the ongoing monitoring of how the App itself is being adopted and used by those who download it.                                                      |
| **â€˜contact tracingâ€™** and **â€˜symptom trackingâ€™** | All of these indicators will be useful for understanding how people are using the app and how the app is supporting the contact tracing process. These will also be useful in understanding how the app should be improved in later versions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | indicators are necessary for ongoing performance monitoring of the App and as a tool for supporting contact tracing and population level symptom tracking.                         |
| **â€˜epidemiologyâ€™**                               | The symptom tracking data is likely to be very noisy. People self reporting will use this tool indifferent ways and at different frequencies. If large amounts of data are collected this will likely mitigate the noise to a sufficient extent to allow aggregate conclusions to be drawn. There are also other very useful indicators that could be collected for this purpose that would be useful â€“ for example the combinations of symptoms typically reported by users, the average duration of symptoms, etc. | indicators are necessary and provide public health value for analysis and modelling purposes and will provide a significant resource for use by the NPHET, the IEMAG, and the HSE. |
